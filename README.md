# Bifid-Encryption
The third puzzle on the Kryptos badge uses an encryption method called "Bifid". Bifid is a polyalphabetic substitution cipher invented around 1901 by FÃ©lix Delastelle. It is usually performed with a polybius square, which is a table of letters or numbers arranged in two rows and two columns.
